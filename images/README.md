2. **Aspect Ratio**: Maintain consistent aspect ratios for similar types of images
3. **File Size**: Optimize images for web to keep file sizes reasonable (typically under 300KB)
4. **Format**: Use JPEG for photographs, PNG for graphics with transparency, or WebP for better compression
5. **Copyright**: Ensure you have the right to use all images. Consider using:
   - Your own photographs
   - Images with Creative Commons licenses
   - Stock photos from free sites like Unsplash, Pexels, or Pixabay
