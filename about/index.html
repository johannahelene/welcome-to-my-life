                    <h2 class="section-subtitle">My Journey</h2>

                        <p>Hey everyone! As most of you know, I'm now in my second year of my PhD in Bioinformatics at the European Bioinformatics Institute and the University of Cambridge and part of Magdalene College. I'm developing computational methods to analyze massive genomic datasets of bacteria.</p>

                        <p>Small trip down memory line: I grew up in Berlin, finished high school in 20215 and then jumped into my Bioinformatics undergrad from 2016-2020. Then came my Masters from 2020-2023, with that amazing internship at the European Bioinformatics Institute in 2022 (those 6 months from May to November definitely convinced me to come back!). While doing the internship my supervisor suggested I apply for a PhD and that's what I did. In May 2023, I packed up and moved back to Cambridge to start this PhD adventure at the European Bioinformatics Institute and the University of Cambridge.</p>

                        <p>Moving from Berlin to Cambridge was definitely a change - from big city life to university town! But I absolutely love Cambridge and that I can bike everywhere here (at it takes less than 15min anywhere!). I love the little cafes in the town center and walking along the river Cam, and rowing makes even the most stressful research days better. It's so different from Berlin's energy, but it feels like home now - though I still miss every terribly!</p>

                    <h2 class="section-subtitle">My Research</h2>

                        <p>My PhD research is centered around developing novel algorithms for navigating large bacterial datasets. While sequencing bacterial DNA gets cheaper, the number of bacterial genomes is increasing rapidly, and we need innovative solutions to deal with this data.</p>
                        
                        <p>Currently, I am getting ready for my 2nd TAC (Thesis Advisory Committee). I have a TAC meeting once a year where experts in the field advise me on how to shape my research direction, evaluate my progress, and provide valuable insights that help me overcome challenges in my project.</p>
                        
                        <p>I am also getting ready to write my first paper. Once this is ready, I will share it with you all (even though this is probably going to take way longer than I'm expecting!). Publishing is such a journey, but I'm excited to see my work in print eventually.</p>
                    
                        <h2 class="section-subtitle">Life at Magdalene College</h2>

                            <p>I am a member of Magdalene College, Cambridge's most beautiful college, in my opinion ;). Founded in 1428, Magdalene has a stunning riverside location, the famous Pepys Library housing Samuel Pepys' diary collection, which is one of the most significant historical documents of 17th-century England, and its charming medieval architecture that makes you feel like you've stepped back in time.</p>
                            
                            <p>I also joined the Magdalene Boat Club (MBC), which is absolutely my favorite hobby here... or is it more a lifestyle? Between early morning training sessions, never-ending ergs, and socials with the crew, rowing has become a huge part of my Cambridge experience! I'll always be happy to talk about it!</p>
                            
                            <p>Great college perks outside of the spectacular boat house and rowing include wonderful formal dinners in our historic hall (the only one in Cambridge that still dines by candlelight), the beautiful college grounds and gardens perfect for studying on sunny days, and a stunning new library!</p>

                        <h2 class="section-subtitle">My Life in Cambridge</h2>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Living in Cambridge has been a wonderful experience. The city is beautiful, with its historic colleges, the River Cam, and lovely green spaces. I live in a beautiful flat a little north of the river, which makes it easy to cycle to the boat house and my favorite brunch place: <a href="https://www.yourstir.co.uk/" target="_blank">Stir</a>.</p>                            
                            <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Probably mostly rowing (5-6 training sessions a week during May Term)</li>
                                <li>Trying out brunch at all Cambridge colleges</li>
                                <li>Experimenting with new recipes in my kitchen</li>
                                <li>Meeting friends at one of the many cozy caf√©s or pubs</li>
                                <li>Crafting and scrapbooking</li>
                            </ul>
                    
                        <h2 class="section-subtitle">Why This Website?</h2>

                            <p>I created this website as a way to keep in touch with everyone across the world. Keeping in touch with everyone is obviously very difficult, but I will try to write about what's happening here every now and then and take you on this ride called my life!</p>
